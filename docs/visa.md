We encourage all international participants to register early to allow enough time for visa processing.

## Letter of Invitation

All international meeting registrants will receive a visa invitation letter upon completion of registration.

If you do not receive an email from SNS 2026 about your letter of invitation, please first check your spam folder. If the email is not there, please contact [info@sns2026.org](mailto:info@sns2026.org). Please include "Letter of Invitation" in the subject, along with the following information:

    - Your name as it appears on your passport
    - Your affiliation and postal mailing address
    - Your submitted abstract title

Allow three to five business days to receive your letter of invitation for a visa application.

## If you have visa problems

The [National Academies’ International Visitors Office (IVO)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/international-visitors-office) is a valuable resource on visa-related issues for scientists. 

## Avoiding Visa Problems

The information on this page is given in good faith, but regulations may change. The only authoritative sources of information are U.S. government websites.

The organizers of SNS 2026 cannot intervene with U.S. Embassies or consulates abroad or with the U.S. State Department on behalf of any meeting attendee.

The best way to avoid visa issues and delays is to:

* Plan ahead

* Apply early

* Bring a copy of your curriculum vitae (CV) to the visa interview

## Estimate how long the application process will take

The Bureau of Consular Affairs provides estimated visa wait times for interviews and non-immigrant visa processing at every U.S. Consular office worldwide.
