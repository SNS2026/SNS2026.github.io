The meeting will bring leading experts in spectroscopy, transport, materials discovery, and theory will meet to address current key challenges in the frontier of superconductivity research. Highlights to be discussed include cuprates, heavy fermions, iron-based superconductors, nickelates, topological superconductivity, superconductivity in twisted quantum materials, strongly correlated electron theory and approaches. We will also highlight insights from gleaned from new experimental methods and experiments under extreme conditions (low temperature, high magnetic field, high pressure, and high laser field) and perspectives for the discovery and design of new superconductors with higher transition temperatures.</p> <ul> <li> <p> Important Dates</p> <p>March 2, 2026: Abstract Submission Opens</p> <p>March 15, 2026: Registration Opens</p> <p>May 31, 2026: Abstract Submission Closes</p> <p>August 24, 2026: Conference Begins</p> </li> <li> <p> Call for Abstracts</p> <p>Abstract submission closes on May 31, 2026</p> <p>Notification of presentation type on June 15, 2026</p> <p>We welcome researchers to contribute to SNS 2026 by submitting an abstract for our scientific Program.</p> <p>Submit Abstract </p> </li> <li> <p> Conference Registration</p> <p>Full conference registration includes: Plenary Session of Oral Presenations, Poster Sessions, Breakfest, Lunch, and Conference Banquet.
